## Asset Creation Guidelines

### Screenshot Capture Best Practices
1. **Resolution:** Capture at actual size or 2x for retina displays
2. **Content:** Use realistic but non-sensitive sample data
3. **Compression:** Use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, Squoosh
4. **Format:** PNG for UI screenshots (transparency, sharp text), JPG for photos
5. **Annotations:** Add arrows, highlights, or boxes to draw attention to key elements
6. **Consistency:** Use same GhostPad theme/settings across all screenshots

### Video Recording Best Practices
1. **Clean Desktop:** Remove personal files, close unnecessary apps
2. **Resolution:** Record at 1920x1080 or higher, scale down if needed
3. **Frame Rate:** 30fps minimum, 60fps preferred for smooth motion
4. **Cursor:** Make cursor visible and movements deliberate
5. **Timing:** Allow pauses for viewers to see what's happening
6. **Editing:** Trim unnecessary parts, add subtle transitions
7. **Compression:** Use H.264 codec with moderate bitrate, optimize with HandBrake
8. **Formats:** Provide MP4 (primary) and WebM (fallback for browsers)

### Design Asset Best Practices
1. **Format:** Use SVG for icons and logos (scalable, small file size)
2. **Colors:** Match site color palette (dark theme)
3. **Consistency:** Maintain same style across all custom icons
4. **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient contrast, don't rely on color alone
5. **Optimization:** Run SVGs through SVGO, images through compression tools

## Placeholder Strategy

Until real assets are available, we will use:

   - Wireframe-style placeholders with descriptive text
   - Or colored rectangles with dimensions and labels

4. **Demo Video:**
   - Placeholder video player with thumbnail
   - "Demo video coming soon" message with screenshot gallery instead

5. **Logo:**
   - Text-based wordmark "GhostPad" in styled typography
   - Or ghost emoji (👻) as temporary icon

6. **Favicon:**
   - Ghost emoji or simple "G" lettermark

7. **OG Image:**
